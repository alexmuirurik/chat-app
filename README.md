Chat app is a coded template for one of the most popular designs on Dribble by [Ronas IT | UI/UX Team.](https://dribbble.com/shots/24911746-Social-Media-Platform) I'll design the front-end using Vite and ReactJs and the backend using NodeJs. 

## Key Features
Key features the app will have include: 

- **Live Chat:** Let the users chat with socket.io and send media 
- **Video Chat:** Allow the users to chat via video
- **Live Streaming:** Let's try to live stream as the app design suggests
