# ChatAPP

Looking to create a chat app using socket.io? Here's a whatsapp clone you can work with to build something interesting. 

![alt text](/static/img/app/Screenshot%202024-05-24%20041049.png)

The app is running on NPM using [HONO](https://hono.dev/), typescript, and JSX in the backend. You might need to do some configuration to run client side features using JSX. 

However, I recommend using plain old javascript to perform client side operations because WHY NOT! 

To run the app, simply clone the repo 

1. Git clone https://github.com/alexmuirurik/chatapp.git
2. npm install 
3. npm run dev
4. npx tailwindcss -i ./app/global.css -o ./static/css/style.css --watch

Happy Coding :)
